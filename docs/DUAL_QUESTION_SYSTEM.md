# 🧠 META-MINDS Dual Question System

## 🎯 Overview

META-MINDS now supports **TWO TYPES** of analytical questions, just like your original META-MINDS project:

1. **📊 Individual Dataset Questions** - Questions for each dataset separately
2. **🔗 Cross-Dataset Questions** - Questions comparing multiple datasets (optional)

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Frontend Interface (Step 5)**

```html
<!-- Individual Dataset Questions -->
<div>
    <label>Individual Dataset Questions</label>
    <input type="number" id="num-questions" value="15" min="5" max="30">
    <p class="text-xs text-gray-500">Questions for each dataset separately</p>
</div>

<!-- Cross-Dataset Questions -->
<div>
    <label>Cross-Dataset Questions (Optional)</label>
    <input type="number" id="num-cross-questions" value="5" min="0" max="20">
    <p class="text-xs text-gray-500">Questions comparing datasets (only if multiple datasets)</p>
</div>
```

### **Backend API Parameters**

```python
async def meta_minds_analysis_tool(
    dataset_path: str,
    business_context: str = "Financial Analysis",
    analysis_focus: str = "Performance evaluation",
    target_audience: str = "Executives",
    num_questions: int = 15,                    # Individual questions
    num_cross_questions: int = 0,               # Cross-dataset questions
    total_datasets: int = 1                      # Total datasets
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

### **Question Generation Logic**

```python
# Generate individual dataset questions
individual_questions = self.question_generator.generate_questions(
    dataset_info, business_context, analysis_focus, 
    target_audience, num_questions
)

# Generate cross-dataset questions if multiple datasets
cross_questions = []
if total_datasets > 1 and num_cross_questions > 0:
    cross_questions = self.question_generator.generate_cross_dataset_questions(
        dataset_info, business_context, analysis_focus,
        target_audience, num_cross_questions, total_datasets
    )

# Combine all questions
questions = individual_questions + cross_questions
```

## 📊 Question Categories

### **Individual Dataset Questions (5 Categories)**

1. **📊 DATA QUALITY & COMPLETENESS**
   - "What data quality issues exist in the dataset?"
   - "How complete is the dataset for analysis?"

2. **📈 PATTERN DISCOVERY**
   - "What patterns emerge in the dataset?"
   - "What trends can be identified?"

3. **⏰ TEMPORAL ANALYSIS**
   - "How do metrics change over time?"
   - "What seasonal patterns exist?"

4. **🎯 BUSINESS IMPACT**
   - "What business insights can be derived?"
   - "What decisions can be made from this data?"

5. **🔗 RELATIONSHIP DISCOVERY**
   - "What relationships exist between variables?"
   - "What correlations can be identified?"

### **Cross-Dataset Questions (5 Categories)**

1. **📊 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS**
   - "How do the key metrics compare across datasets?"
   - "What are the performance differences between datasets?"

2. **🔗 RELATIONSHIP DISCOVERY**
   - "What relationships exist between datasets?"
   - "How do changes in one dataset affect others?"

3. **📈 TREND COMPARISON**
   - "How do temporal trends compare across datasets?"
   - "What seasonal patterns are consistent?"

4. **🎯 BUSINESS IMPACT**
   - "What business decisions can be made by comparing datasets?"
   - "What strategic opportunities emerge?"

5. **🔍 DATA QUALITY**
   - "How consistent is data quality across datasets?"
   - "What data gaps exist when comparing datasets?"

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### **Single Dataset Analysis**
```
Individual Questions: 15
Cross-Dataset Questions: 0
Total Datasets: 1
Result: 15 individual questions only
```

### **Multi-Dataset Analysis**
```
Individual Questions: 15
Cross-Dataset Questions: 5
Total Datasets: 3
Result: 15 individual + 5 cross-dataset = 20 total questions
```

### **Comprehensive Multi-Dataset Analysis**
```
Individual Questions: 20
Cross-Dataset Questions: 10
Total Datasets: 5
Result: 20 individual + 10 cross-dataset = 30 total questions
```

## 🔍 Question Examples

### **Individual Dataset Questions**
```
📊 DATA QUALITY & COMPLETENESS
"What data quality issues exist in sales_data.csv?"

📈 PATTERN DISCOVERY  
"What patterns emerge in the customer behavior data?"

⏰ TEMPORAL ANALYSIS
"How do sales metrics change over time?"

🎯 BUSINESS IMPACT
"What business insights can be derived from the revenue data?"

🔗 RELATIONSHIP DISCOVERY
"What relationships exist between customer age and purchase amount?"
```

### **Cross-Dataset Questions**
```
📊 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
"How do the key metrics in sales_data.csv compare across the 3 datasets?"

🔗 RELATIONSHIP DISCOVERY
"What relationships exist between sales_data.csv and other datasets?"

📈 TREND COMPARISON
"How do the temporal trends in sales_data.csv compare to other datasets?"

🎯 BUSINESS IMPACT
"What business decisions can be made by comparing sales_data.csv with other datasets?"

🔍 DATA QUALITY
"How consistent is the data quality across all 3 datasets?"
```

## 📈 Results Display

### **Analysis Information Panel**
```html
<div class="bg-blue-50 p-3 rounded border border-blue-200">
    <strong>📊 Individual Questions:</strong> 15
</div>
<div class="bg-purple-50 p-3 rounded border border-purple-200">
    <strong>🔗 Cross-Dataset Questions:</strong> 5
</div>
```

### **Question Categories in Results**
- Individual questions show normal categories
- Cross-dataset questions show cross-dataset categories
- Each question is marked with its type
- Quality scores apply to both types

## 🚀 Benefits
